# A-Frame Node Project

Serving aframe with node/budu on glitch or local.

## Next Steps

## Done

- updating a a-element with innerHTML, keeping framestuff alive. but inspector does not see changed dom
- init-module for two levels of reload

- selfhostet and appcached aframe and inspector, better for local development
- make budo run on glitch
- using budo without reload too. Workaround with very long poll time
- appcache for big files, seems to work with external hosts too
- using hotreloaded scene
- module-level hotreload with browserify-hmr, really fast
- put scene-html automatically in js for better reload (hot or appcache)
- reload faster
- host it locally
- use seperate aframe 
- use aframe per npm and budo by require. Problem: 5mb download everytime
- use budo locally, as in builerplate

## Your Project on Glitch

OUTDATED

On the front-end,
- edit `modules/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
- download files mentioned in external/README.md from console.

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Glitch: safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
